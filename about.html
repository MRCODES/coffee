            <h1 class="huge">Our Story</h1>

            <p>We began exhorting one another to "Never Settle for Good Enough" many years ago.It sounded like a slogan or part of a
            branding campaign, but over time, this attitude has become its own mantra that guides everything we do at Onyx.
            The first step is to travel to the best coffee shops.This occurs in numerous nations, continents, and terrains.We
            maintain high standards for the taste and score of our coffees.When the coffees arrive at our headquarters, we roast,
            cup, and fine-tune the roast profiles until they shine in the cup.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
            Every weekday, we use solar energy from our facility's roof to roast and ship coffee.In order to monitor the
            characteristics of our coffees and provide feedback on roast profiles, a sample from each roast is cupped for quality.As
            a result, we can guarantee that each coffee we deliver will not only meet our standards but also be truly
            exceptional.You can look at this data right here on our website.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
            Every espresso we have is joined by its evaluating and exchange information, meaning you can see what we paid for it,
            what it scored at, who we got it from, and different subtleties right on its item page.We are extremely proud of this,
            and it is also a practice that is uncommon in coffee.We want you to understand the ins and outs of how this coffee
            became one of our offerings.We want the names of our producing partners to be listed and acknowledged for their
            innovative efforts in cultivating some of the best coffees.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
            When we serve coffee, we start long before there is a customer in front of us.From farming to cupping to preparation,
            in-depth classes, hands-on skill development, and repetition in our training lab are the first steps in teaching the
            fundamentals of coffee and espresso.We are proud of the time and expertise our trainers devote to each member of our
            staff, which extends to our wholesale partners and coffee enthusiasts.We provide curriculum for home users as well as
            high-end cafes.<br>
            </p>

            <p>

            Our aim is for you to feel at home, to be seen, and to be heard in our cafes, and to find the perfect coffee or pastry
            for you.It's the assistance at the end that finishes the inventory network.There is a skill involved.We want people from
            our neighborhood to work, read, and have conversations in our cafes.Our staff includes some of the best coffee
            professionals in the United States, and every drink, interaction, and item is carefully prepared, carefully monitored,
            and executed to perfection.<br>
            </p>

            <p>

            You can rely on the fact that excellence and hospitality are at the heart of every aspect of our business, regardless of
            whether you are an expert in the coffee industry or just starting out.Accompany the pilgrimage.
            </p>
